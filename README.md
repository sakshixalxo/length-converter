Welcome to my Length Converter Website! 

This project is designed to help users convert lengths from one unit to another quickly and easily. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website features a user-friendly interface where users can input a length in one unit and receive the converted length in another unit. Whether you need to convert meters to feet, inches to centimeters, or any other length conversion, this tool provides an accurate and efficient solution.

This project showcases my ability to develop practical web applications that solve real-world problems. By leveraging HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the conversion logic, I created a responsive and interactive experience that works seamlessly across various devices. The Length Converter Website not only demonstrates my web development skills but also reflects my commitment to creating useful and accessible tools for everyday use. Feel free to explore the site and see how easy it is to convert lengths between different units.
